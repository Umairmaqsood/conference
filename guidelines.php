<h2>2.2 Headings (All headings should be aligned to extreme left of the margin)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Initial letter of each notional word in all headings is capitalized.</li>
    <li>The line space between and heading and subsequent text should be 1.5 points.</li>
    <li>Align all headings to extreme left, numbered with decimals. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>The second level two heading under the third level one heading should be numbered as 3.2.</li>
            <li>Level 3 heading, numbered after the level two headings, such as 3.2.1, 3.2.2, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Equations and Mathematical Expressions</h2>
<p>An equation should be written in Equation editor. The equation number should be kept at right extreme. See Eq. (1) for an example.</p>
<p class="equation">E=mc<sup>2</sup> <span class="equation-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      (1)</span></p>

<h2>4. Figures and Tables</h2>
<p>Figures and tables help in better understanding of the manuscript text. Remember following guidelines for tables and figures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always insert a suitable caption (brief but comprehensive) for each figure and table.</li>
    <li>For a table the caption should be on its top, while for a figure it should be in its bottom.</li>
    <li>The border lines of a table should be in light-gray color. Use of light color increases visibility of the text inside the cells.</li>
    <li>Align the figures and tables in center of the page margins. Figure 1 and Table 1 represent the required formatting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Graphs and Charts</h2>
<p>Graphs and Charts also help in better understanding of the manuscript text. Remember following guidelines for them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always insert a title (brief but comprehensive) for each graph and chart.</li>
    <li>Adding graph labels, legends and data labels increase their effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Align the graph and chart in center of the page margins.</li>
    <li>Consult example of a graph (Figure 1) in the template for research article.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Citations</h2>
<p>Cite references in the main text, by following the IEEE style like [1].</p>

<h2>7. Optional Parts</h2>
<h2 class="optional-heading">Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>The acknowledgements section is your opportunity to thank those who have helped and supported you personally and professionally during your research work process.</p>

<h2 class="optional-heading">Conflict of Interests</h2>
<p>Authors are requested to disclose interests that are directly or indirectly related to the work submitted for publication. Interests within the last 3 years of beginning the work (conducting the research and preparing the work for submission) should be reported.</p>

<h2 class="optional-heading">Funding Statement</h2>
<p>FUJEAS requires authors to specify any sources of funding (institutional, private and corporate financial support) for the work reported in their paper. This information, in the form of the name of the funding organization/s and the grant number -or should be included at the end of the article under the heading ‘Funding’, and provided at the time of submitting the paper. Any suppliers of materials should be named and their location included if appropriate. This information will be included in the published article.</p>

<h2>8. References</h2>
<p>The reference should be given in IEEE format. Avoid unnecessary references, as they create confusion. Keep in mind following points about them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The facts given a reference should be correct and complete.</li>
    <li>Ensure completeness of critical elements of information (Title, Authors’ Names, Year, Venue, Volume, Issue and Page Numbers).</li>
    <li>All references should be cited in the text.</li>
    <li>Check for duplicate references.</li>
    <li>All references should be in font size 8 and listed at the end of the paper.</li>
    <li>Remember that every resource (conference paper, book or online electronic resource etc.) has some specific data:
        <ul>
            <li>Titles of books and conference are in italics, with the first letter of the notional word capitalized.</li>
            <li>The first letter of Titles of articles, reports, dissertations and conferences should be capitalized.</li>
            <li>References should be arranged in the order in which they appear in the text.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
